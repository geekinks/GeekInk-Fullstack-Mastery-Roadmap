## The Problem

## The Solution

Based on experience for years mentoring people in different stages using a `dynamic MVP-style roadmap` with hands-on projects designed by an experienced Fullstack engineer has been highly successful.

That means **first, understanding the problem instead of just learning a bunch of tools** and then **using an iterative style, each iteration will cover most DevOps areas used in the job** to build a T-shaped skills profile from day one! It's also essential to set the targeted market and organizations because, with different DevOps topologies, the DevOps engineer role requirements vary a lot.

## Roadmap Modes

This roadmap adapts to different learning speeds and preferences, making it ideal for both beginners and those looking to deepen their skills.

### Self-Learning Path
Goal: Take learners from zero to job-ready fullstack developers.

Who is it for? Beginners who want to start their career as fullstack engineers.

Approach: A structured learning plan across modules, guiding students through the key technologies and tools required for web development. This mode empowers learners to manage their own progress and learning timelines.

Resources: Each module provides comprehensive learning materials, tutorials, and assignments to reinforce knowledge.

üí° Tip: It's highly recommended to have a peer or senior developer review your projects and progress to ensure you're on the right track.

### Hands-on Projects

#### Goal: 

Help developers with some experience (1-2 years) level up their skills by building real-world, production-ready applications.
Who is it for? Intermediate developers who want to tackle more complex, industry-grade projects.

#### Approach: 

This mode follows a learning-by-doing approach, guiding learners through real-world projects like building web applications, integrating databases, implementing user authentication, and deploying to cloud platforms.

#### Project Cycle: 

The roadmap covers all key stages of web development, including:
Frontend frameworks (React, Vue.js)
Backend systems (Node.js, Express)
Database integration (SQL/NoSQL)
CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and cloud deployment

#### Note: 

Projects are divided into standalone phases that align with roadmap modules, so learners can work on them as they complete each phase.

### Mentorship Program

#### Goal: 

Provide guided learning support for those who want personalized mentorship to accelerate their progress.

Who is it for? Beginners and intermediates looking for expert guidance and personalized learning plans.

#### Approach: 

Learners are paired with a fullstack development expert who provides personalized feedback, monitors progress, and assists with project development.

#### Overcoming Common Barriers:

**Power Supply** One of the biggest challenges learners face is consistent access to 
electricity. At Geek Ink Lab, we provide an uninterrupted power supply, ensuring you can focus on your learning and projects without the worry of outages.

**Access to Personal Computers** Not everyone has access to a reliable personal computer. Our lab is equipped with high-performance PCs, giving every learner the tools needed to build and test their applications in a real-world environment.

**Internet Access** We understand that many learners struggle with internet connectivity. Geek Ink Lab offers a robust, high-speed internet connection so that you can access online resources, collaborate with peers, and deploy your projects smoothly.

Agile Board: Learners will also have access to an Agile roadmap board, utilizing tools like Kanban and Epics to structure their learning, mimicking a real-world Agile environment.

>>**Bonus** 
You will also gain real-world experience by working with Agile best practices that are vital in professional software development.
